               	 	//////// How to Play /////////

 On welcome screen, press S to start the game.
 Use arrow keys or WASD to move, Q to pause, E to resume, and R to restart.
 Gaming mechanics is just like the original Pacman.

 In case you were living under a rock and doesn't know what Pacman is (or too 
 young to know), here's a brief summary (of the parts that we implemented):
 - Eat pellets to earn points.
 - Don't get eaten by ghosts or you'll die a very painful death.
 - Eat power pellets to briefly enter freight mode, where you can take revenge.
 - Each ghost has a different personality, so study it well to win.

 Scoring is as follows:
 - 10 pts for each pellet
 - 50 pts for each power pellet
 - 200 for the first ghost eaten in freight mode, double the previous score for
   each additional ghost eaten in the same occurance of freight mode (i.e. 200
   for the 1st, 400 for the 2nd, 800 for the 3rd, resets for every freight mode).
